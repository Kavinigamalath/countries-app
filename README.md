## Brief Report

### APIs Used

- `GET /all` – fetch all countries  
- `GET /name/{name}` – search by name  
- `GET /region/{region}` – filter by region  
- `GET /alpha/{code}` – detail view by country code  

### Challenges & Resolutions
- **CORS errors when calling REST Countries API in development**: Solved by using vite.config.js with proper proxy or directly calling HTTPS endpoints in the client.
- **Difficulty managing user sessions across refresh and routing**: Used onAuthStateChanged() from Firebase Auth to persist login state and load favorites on app load.
- **Google Sign-In failing on deployed domain (Cloudflare Pages)**: Added the domain to Firebase Auth..Authentication..Sign-in Method..Authorized domains.
- **Slow API response time for large /all endpoint**: Added loading spinners and optimized rendering using React memoization and conditional rendering.
- **Issues with FireStore document structure (overwrites)**: Solved by using document paths like favorites/{uid} and ensuring .set() with { merge: true }.
- **Tailwind Setup**: Required `postcss.config.js` and correct purge globs to remove unused styles.  
- **React Router in Tests**: Used polyfill for `TextEncoder` and mocked `react-router-dom` to fix hook-related test errors.  
- **Language Filter**: Used a `Set` and `useMemo` to extract unique languages from nested API responses.  
- **Favorites Persistence**: User-selected favorite countries are stored and retrieved using `Firebase Firestore`, ensuring persistent access across sessions.
